Project Virtual Mouse utilizes Python packages! 
Leveraging computer vision and hand tracking capabilities provided by OpenCV and MediaPipe, the project enables users to control the mouse cursor on their computer screen using hand gestures captured through their webcam.

The OpenCV library facilitates webcam access and real-time video processing, allowing the system to track the user's hand movements with precision. MediaPipe offers robust hand tracking functionalities, accurately recognizing hand landmarks and gestures in the video feed.

PyAutoGUI, on the other hand, provides the means to control the mouse cursor and simulate mouse clicks, enabling users to interact with the computer interface using hand gestures detected by the system.

By combining these powerful Python libraries, the Virtual Mouse project offers users an intuitive and intuitive alternative to traditional mouse control, enhancing accessibility and providing an immersive hands-free computing experience.
